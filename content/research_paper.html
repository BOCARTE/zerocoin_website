 [IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland) 2013](http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/) | [PDF]({{media_url('pdf/ZerocoinOakland.pdf')}})| Abstract:
> Bitcoin is the ﬁrst e-cash system to see widespread
> adoption. While Bitcoin offers the potential for new types of
> ﬁnancial interaction, it has signiﬁcant limitations regarding
> privacy. Speciﬁcally, because the Bitcoin transaction log is
> completely public, users’ privacy is protected only through 
> the use of pseudonyms. In this paper we propose Zerocoin, a 
> cryptographic extension to Bitcoin  that augments the protocol
> to allow for fully anonymous currency transactions. Our system
> uses standard cryptographic assumptions and does not introduce
> new trusted parties or otherwise change the security model of
> Bitcoin. We detail Zerocoin’s cryptographic construction, its
> integration into Bitcoin, and examine its performance both in
>  terms of computation and impact on the Bitcoin protocol.
