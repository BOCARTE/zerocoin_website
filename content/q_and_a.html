### Why do I care?
Bitcoin is, in a lot of ways, less private than a bank account.
With a bank, you only disclose your finances to the bank and their designees.
With Bitcoin, you disclose it to the world since the block chain and all your transactions
are public.  Naïvely, you might think this is not an issue,
since your name is not associated with your Bitcoin address(s)/public key(s). 
However,  it is not very hard to identify who an address 
belongs to based on spending patterns.  So if you have any desire for your 
neighbors or retailers not to know what you spend your money on, you should be 
interested in techniques to anonymize Bitcoin.  Zerocoin is the only 
solution to this that offers provable anonymity even if *everyone* 
running the network is out to get you.

### Can I use it now?
Unfortunately, no. We plan on releasing prototype code in June. For Zerocoin to 
be useful, however, it either needs to be integrated
into Bitcoin, adopted by some other alternative block chain currency, or become an alternative currency itself and get some adoption. This will take time. Follow [@ZerocoinProject](https://twitter.com/ZerocoinProject "ZerocoinProject") on twitter and check this site for updates.

### What's this about a backdoor?
There is no backdoor and there never was.  
This was a misinterpretation of the following quote in 
the paper and a less than ideally phrased answer in an interview.

The idea was even if you are one of the "if you haven't done anything wrong, you 
have nothing to hide [from the government]" people (an assertion that we by no 
means agree with), you'd still want privacy from the general public. After all, 
we have banking secrecy laws for a reason --- you don't want your neighbors 
knowing your financial details even if you want the FBI to know everything 
about criminals or terrorists. Even if you wanted that world, you'd
need something like Zerocoin to make sure only the "good guys" could use it.

### Could you put a backdoor in it?
Not covertly.  The paper has a provably secure protocol in it which is anonymous 
(technical note: anonymity holds even if the RSA key used in the accumulator is 
retained, so no that's not a backdoor), so absent modifications there is no way to 
track users. The software will be open source and so any attempt to modify the protocol by inserting a backdoor would be rather obvious.

As with any protocol (Bitcoin included), the government could mandate an overt 
locked "frontdoor" so to speak. On a technical level, these kind of things tend 
not to [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip#Vulnerability "Clipper 
Chip") for decentralized systems.  Moreover, since Zerocoin will be open source 
any version that had such a frontdoor in it would likely be forked and have it 
removed. 

### What about money laundering?
First, the main problem with money laundering tends to be making the money 
appear legitimate (after all, they nailed Al Capone for tax fraud), not actually moving 
it around. Anonymity doesn't help with that since you need to actually identify
the sources of your income (e.g., for tax purposes) to show it is legitimate.

However, Bitcoin and Zerocoin obviously make it easier to move 
money around, which is step one in laundering money. There are, however,
promising techniques for preventing money laundering without violating the
privacy of non-launderers (e.g., [this paper](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~susan/papers/CHL06.pdf "Balancing Accountability 
and Privacy Using E-Cash ")). The basic idea is if you spend more than x amount
in one transaction (e.g., ten thousand USD), then the transaction is identified.
If you spend less than that, you are completely anonymous. This does not depend on
a trusted party to make the determination, rather it is a property of the cryptographic protocol. 
Considerably more work needs to be done to apply these techniques to Bitcoin and Zerocoin
and to prevent more sophisticated money laundering techniques, but it is a promising
research topic. Whether anyone wants to adopt this technology is a policy question
(as are what the exact thresholds or patterns that trigger identification). There must be a consensus
on this to adopt it and put it in the code. Without that consensus, miners would not adopt the code and users would
not use it. But it is an option.
